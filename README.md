# Hospitality-Analysis
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

I built an interactive Hospitality Analysis Dashboard to visualize key metrics such as revenue, occupancy rates, cancellation trends, and customer ratings. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I’m thrilled to showcase it!


# ✅ Key Features:

Comprehensive insights: Revenue, occupancy %, cancellations, and average ratings in one place.
Comparative analysis: Weekday vs. weekend trends for better scheduling and resource allocation.
City-wise performance: Detailed breakdown of revenue and occupancy rates across major cities.
Booking platform analysis: Highlights which platforms drive more bookings and cancellations.


# 🌟 What I’ve Implemented:

Advanced DAX measures to calculate key KPIs dynamically.
Drill-through filters and slicers to enable interactive exploration of data.
Clear, visually appealing design using best practices in data visualization.
Focused on storytelling by connecting data trends with actionable insights.

# 📚 What I’ve Learned:

Enhanced my skills in creating advanced visualizations and using DAX formulas.
Developed a better understanding of hospitality metrics and their impact on decision-making.
Learned how to organize and structure dashboards for different stakeholder needs.

# 💡 How It Can Help:

# This dashboard is designed to help hospitality managers:
1️⃣ Monitor and improve occupancy rates and revenue streams.
2️⃣ Identify high-performing cities and booking platforms.
3️⃣ Analyze cancellation patterns to minimize losses.
4️⃣ Make data-driven decisions to optimize customer experience.
